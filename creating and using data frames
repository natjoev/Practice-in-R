## this activity is on creating and using data frames 

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

##load the data set
data("diamonds")
View(diamonds)
head(diamonds) # this gives a few lines 
str(diamonds) # high level info on your data 
colnames(diamonds) # colum names of your data frame

## to edit your data frame. 
mutatate(diamonds, carat_2 = carat*100) # this makes a new column ( , y) in a given data frame (x, )

## now to the actual activity

## on the manual creation of data frames
# step one, create some vectors 
# step two, collect them in a data frame using `data.frame()` function
# example...

name <- c("NJ", "Theo", "Paul")
age <- c(21L, 2L, 99L) # L is used to show that these are integers
# you can then create a data frame using these two vectors

people <- data.frame(name, age) # this creates the data frame
# you can now view/inspect the data frame using the commands executed before (i.e. line 7-11)
# but we will use glimpse() for this 
glimpse(people)

### now to have some fun :> 

summary(people, ave_age = mean(age))

### exercise 

fruit <- c("banana", "mango", "apple", "watermelon", "grapes")
score <- c(4, 3, 5, 1, 2)
fruit_score <- data.frame(fruit, score)

top_fruits <- fruit_score %>%
arrange(score) # no need to express where it came from

top_fruits

is_yummy <- c("yes","yes","yes","yes","yes")
mutate(top_fruits, is_yummy)
