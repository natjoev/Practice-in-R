### on using ggplot2 - colors, different geoms, and facets
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

View(penguins)

## suppose you want to find the relationship between body mass and flipper
## length with the species

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
# first argument is the data to use, + is to add a layer to the plot, geompoint
# is used to define what the axes are, which is defined by aes().

## with the activity, we use hotel_bookings again 
setwd('C:/Users/ael/OneDrive/Desktop')
read.csv('hotel_bookings.csv')
hotel_bookings <- read.csv('hotel_bookings.csv')

head(hotel_bookings)

## to determine if adults with children will tend to book more in advance
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))

## another problem 
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = stays_in_weekend_nights, x = children))

### now on to the actual activity

ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel) , fill = "blue")

ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel, fill = deposit_type))
# interestingly, it includes the amount of the observation while also grouping them by deposit type through different colors.

## on using facets

ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type)

## for a more complex example 
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type~market_segment) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) # this creates the tick legend for x axis
