## on viewing data
head(diamonds) # displays first several rows of data
str(diamonds) # type of data of each column
glimpse(diamonds) # just like head() but this switches it up to horizontal
colnames(diamonds) # lists the columns 

## on cleaning data
rename(diamonds, carat_new = carat) # this function will rename the column
summarize(diamonds, mean_carat = mean(carat)) # makes a statistic from an operator

## on visualizing 
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() 
# this puts your data in a scatterplot (from the second expression), where the data and axes are determined by the first expression
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + geom_point() # this adds color which is grouped by cut
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~cut) 
# this splits the data into separate scatterplots, grouped by cut
