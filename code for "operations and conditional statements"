# practice with operators and conditional statements
# in this example we are handling observations with extreme weather, namely solar > 150 and wind > 10
data("airquality")
View(airquality)

airquality[, "Solar.R"] > 150 & airquality[, "Wind"] >10
# in the previous line of code, "&" aka AND will state the observations that meet BOTH criteria as "TRUE"

airquality[, "Solar.R"] > 150 | airquality[, "Wind"] >10
# in contrast with the line of code in 7, the "|" aka EITHER OR symbol is for filtering which observations meet either criteria  

airquality[, "Day"] != 1 #this will return days that are not the first days of the month. "!=" here is aka NOT
!(airquality[, "Solar.R"] > 150 & airquality[, "Wind"] >10)
# running this code with a ! on the whole thing will give you days that are neither sunny nor windy.

# on conditional operators, namely if(), else(), and else if()...

# example on if 
if (x>0) {
  print("x is a positive number")
}
# if (condition) THEN {expression}

# example on else
if (x>0) {
  print("x is a positive number")
} else {
  print ("x is either a negative number or zero")
}

# Applying this to this data set, the goal is to see if day 1 is a hot day or not. 

if (airquality$Temp[1] < 80) {
  print("it's not a hot day")
} else {
  print("it's not a hot day")
}

# example on else if
x <- -1
if (x < 0) {
  print("x is a negative number")
} else if (x == 0) {
  print("x is zero")
} else {
  print("x is a positive number")
}
# in this case, if condition 1, which is if x is a negative number, is not met, move on to condition 2, if not, then move on to condition 3

# Applying this to our dataset... 

ozone_level <- airquality[1,"Ozone"]
if(is.na(ozone_level)){
  print("Ozone reading is missing for the first day.")
} else if(ozone_level < 30){ 
  print("Low ozone level.")
} else if(ozone_level < 100){ 
  print("Moderate ozone level.")
} else{
  print("High ozone level.")
