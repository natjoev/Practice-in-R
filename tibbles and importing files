## on using tibbles and importing data

library(tidyverse) 
data(diamonds)
View(diamonds)
 
as_tibble(diamonds) # CUTEEEEEEEEEEE

data() # this function explores available data frames 
data(mtcars) # this will load the specific data frame mtcars
as_tibble(mtcars)

## the read() function is used to read rectangular data 
# read_csv(): comma-separated values (.csv) files
# read_tsv(): tab-separated values files
# read_delim(): general delimited files
# read_fwf(): fixed-width files
# read_table(): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space
# read_log(): web log files

## additionally, you can use the read_excel() function for .xls and .xml stuff
## you would have to load library(readxl) first


## more on importing and working with data
setwd('C:\Users\ael\OneDrive\Desktop') # to tell R where to look for the file
read_csv("hotel_bookings.csv") # code used to import
bookings_df <- read_csv("hotel_bookings.csv") # to make a data frame using the .csv file
